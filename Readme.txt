I have prepared a Makefile and I have attached in this folder which will be helpful in the code easily.

Steps to run the module inside the VM:

1. Simply type "make" to compile my code
2. Then to insert module, simply type "make insert".--this will insert "process_list.ko"
3. To execute my code, simply type "make execute"
4. To remove a module, simply type "make remove"--this will remove the module
5. Then we have to clean ...for this simply type "make clean"


I have attached a copy of my results as a screenshot herewith this folder
